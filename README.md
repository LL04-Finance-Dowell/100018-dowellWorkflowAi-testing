## for project team members
- Be working on a branch other than `main`, simply:
    - `$ git checkout -B <my_branch>`
- When you push, push to your branch
    - `git push origin <my_branch>`
- if backend: you are advised to work isolated in the `backend` directory, which has all the files you need.
- if frontend: you are advised to work on the `frontend` directory.

Happy Hacking.
