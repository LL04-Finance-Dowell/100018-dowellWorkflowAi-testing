# Folder Details

This folder contains all files that act as a blueprint to layout the application pages.

To add a new layout, simply:
- Create a folder in this directory that has a name decribing what the layout does
- Then feel free to create the `.js` or `.jsx` and/or the `.css` file for the layout in that folder
